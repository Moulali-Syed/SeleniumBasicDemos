we have  files of jar type either we have to download them or we can see 4 lines of code below as dependency then maven will download all jars
it has groupid - organisation project , artifactid - subproject in org project , version

By Default java project doesnot have maven knowledge 
so right click on project - configure - Convert to Maven Project

it will ask for 
GroupId : like organisation name
ArtifactId : Selenium-java
Version:give any version or leave as it is
package : jar 
Click on Finish
