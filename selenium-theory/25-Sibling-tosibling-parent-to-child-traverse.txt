Absoulte xpath : start from html and traverse we start with /
/html/header
Relative xpath: when ever we go // it will understand it is relative xpath
//header/div

sibling - sibling
//header/div/button[1]/following-sibling::button[1]

child to parent traversal
//header/div/button[1]/parent::div/parent::header/a


in css this is not possible child to parent , sibling to sibling
