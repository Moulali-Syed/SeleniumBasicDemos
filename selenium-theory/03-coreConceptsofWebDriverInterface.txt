Create a java class inside src folder

Invoke browser:

We have an interface called WebDriver
Interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies .Its class responsibitlity to implement methods declared in interface
When class agreed to implement the interface they must need to provide implementation / bodies to all defined methods in interface
in simple terms interface enforces the contract to class to follow

WebDriver is an interface which provides set of browser automation methods with empty bodies(Abstract Methods)
Classes like ChromeDriver,FirefoxDriver,MicrosoftDriver,SafariDriver etc implement webdriver interface
and provide their own implementation to webdriver methods

We need to create object of class to access methods present in the class
ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver object here has access to all methods of chromedriver

WebDriver driver  =  new ChromeDriver();
driver object here has access to methods of chrome driver which are defined in webdriver interface
ChromeDriver has access to WebDriver methods and also has access to personal driver methods


import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
WebDriver

import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
ChromeDriver
