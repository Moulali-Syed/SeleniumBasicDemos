Selenium WebDriver architecture simplified:

write code in selenium java
After you trigger the test , complete selenium code (Client) which we have written will be converted to JSON Format
Generated JSON is sent to browser Driver(Server) through http protocol.
Note:Each browser contains a seperate browser driver
Browser Driver communicates with its respective browser and executes the commands by interpreting json which it received on the browser
Browser Driver receives responses back from browser and it sends json response back to client

client(our code) --->transferred over http protocol in form of JSON ---> reaches browser Driver ---> this will communicate with the browser
