Data structure:
it is a way of organizing data in a computer
Why should we organize data? what happens if we don't organize data properly

Lets imagine a library , we want to read a particular book
if library has no particular order of arrangement of books , there may be a chance that
a library may have 10 or 50 lakhs of books , from these huge number of collection
how will you reach to the book u want to read , if it is not organised properly
its impossible to find the book

This is the reason ,library books are arranged in some order
For example : Fiction books are in one place , NonFiction books are in one place
				even there in shelves books are placed in alphabetical order, in such a
				case it will be quite easy to find a book , it doesnot matter library
				has huge number of books , if library books are arranged in some order
				then its not a big deal to find required book

This is the importance of organizing things

Same is followed in books selling shop
there will be a seperate section for best selling books , highest rated books ,
famous author section books ,... this way it is easy to customers to pick a right book
in which they are interested in

Dictionary : is a perfect for data structure
say u want to search some word from dictionary , in dictionary we have lakhs of words
we want to search apple , we go to a then p


Organizing things is quite normal in day to day life , our room in home
groceries in kitchen

Data Structure:
Organizing the data in a computer , so data can be used efficiently
Data structure is not a technique its a skill
Its not about only storing or organizing data , its also about choosing right data
Data structures is important to store the data , but way of storing data is more
than important than storing the data
