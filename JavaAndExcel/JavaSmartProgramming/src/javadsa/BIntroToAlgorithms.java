Algorithms:

Find Bigger One -  1	4	2	3	9	5	6
9 is bigger

We started looking from 1 and so on till end 
 1 ---> 4[now 4 is bigger]
 4 ---->2[still 4 is bigger]
 2----> 3[still 4 is biger]
 9 ---> 5[9 is bigger]
 5 ----> 6 [9 is bigger in the list]
 
 we have used a procedure to identify bigger number is algorithm
 
 Algorithm is well defined procedure to implement the critical business logics
 
 Thus Algorithm is a sequence of steps that transform the input into the output
 
 Lets consider preparing Omelette
 get frying pan
 get oil
 	do we have oil? 
 		if yes , put in pan
 		if no do we want to buy oil?
 			if yes then go out and buy
 			if no we can terminate
 Turn on stove 
 
 Algorithm is step by step instructions working behind the scenes
