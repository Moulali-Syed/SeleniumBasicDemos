package java2;

public class NArray {

}
/*
 suppose we have so many employees in a company

 int emp_id =101;
 int emp_id =102;
 ..............

 int emp_id =1000;

 instead we can store all emp_id in a single variable

 Array is collection of homogeneous data

 int emp_id[] = new int[1000];

 accessing elements in array:
 can access with index

  new keyword is used for object creation , array is object
  array super class is Object

  array occupies memory in Heap

  index value start from 0,.....

  advantages:
  speed of array is fast compared to primitive variable declaration because there is
  not internal conversion of wrapper class

  disadvantages:
  size is fixed , cant increase it run time
  wastage of memory is high
  only similar datatype values will be stored
  if we remove a single element in a array from middle , all elements next to it
  should move one position ahead , thus decrease array performance
 String emp_name[] = new String[1000];
